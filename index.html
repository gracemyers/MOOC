    <h2>Description</h2>
        
    One of the first questions my young students asked me when I started teaching was “when is your birthday?”. After speaking with the bilingual coordinator at my school, I decided to use the student’s inherent interest in this subject as the premise of my final project. Given that this topic is inspired by the student’s interest, it is more engaging for the students. Also, it is an original way to teach them about a part of American culture, how we celebrate birthdays,  and is something they can understand and compare to their own culture around birthdays. 
    <br>
    <br>
    This lesson on birthdays in the USA will help students to understand a part of American culture they might not otherwise engage with. Additionally, this topic allows students to engage with different vocabulary than they typically work with, such as words around celebrating, decorating, and coming of age. 
    <br>
    <br>
    The materials in this lesson plan are also transferable to other age groups. These slides and activities could be adopted to suit a younger age group, by simplifying the questions asked and increasing the teacher’s involvement in clarifying what different terms and traditions mean for the USA in the Spanish culture. The lesson can also be modified to fit an older age group by adding more complex questions or an additional activity that involves cultural comparison to deepen the level of analysis required by the students.

    <br>
    <i>How the teacher and learning assistant will work together:</i> The teacher and learning assistant will work as a team by both engaging with the students to make sure they are understanding the presentation and by both facilitating the Kahoot.
    <br>

    <br>
    <i>Evaluating the activities:</i> The presentation’s effectiveness will be evaluated by the student’s level of engagement in answering the questions throughout the presentation. The effectiveness of the Kahoot will be evaluated through the accuracy of the student’s responses.
    <br>
    <i>How students will know they have achieved the learning objectives:</i> Students will know they have achieved the learning objectives by their ability to engage in questions throughout the presentation and by the immediate evaluation on the accuracy of their responses they receive through using Kahoot. 
    <br>
    <i>Responding to the diverse learning styles and levels of achievement among the students:</i> The learning assistant and teacher will work in conjunction in order to attend to the diverse learning styles and levels of achievement among students. By having two facilitators for this lesson, there is ample opportunity to stop and answer questions, as well as alter the vocabulary used in order to meet the needs of various types of learners.
